# Universal Ordinary, Stochastic, and Partial Diffrential Equation Examples

For examples of using universal ordinary and stochastic differential equations,
along with universal partial differential equations, see the [Universal Differential Equations for Scientific Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04385) paper along with its [examples repository](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/universal_differential_equations)
