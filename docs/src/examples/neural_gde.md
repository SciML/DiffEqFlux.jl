# Neural Graph Differential Equations

This tutorial has been adapted from [here](https://github.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl/blob/master/examples/gcn.jl).

In this tutorial we will use Graph Differential Equations (GDEs) to perform classification on the [CORA Dataset](https://relational.fit.cvut.cz/dataset/CORA). We shall be using the Graph Neural Networks primitives from the package [GeometricFlux](https://github.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl).

## Load the Dataset

The dataset is available in the desired format in the GeometricFlux repository. We shall download the dataset from there, and use the JLD2 package to load the data.

```julia
download("https://rawcdn.githack.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl/a94ca7ce2ad01a12b23d68eb6cd991ee08569303/data/cora_features.jld2", "cora_features.jld2")
download("https://rawcdn.githack.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl/a94ca7ce2ad01a12b23d68eb6cd991ee08569303/data/cora_graph.jld2", "cora_graph.jld2")
download("https://rawcdn.githack.com/yuehhua/GeometricFlux.jl/a94ca7ce2ad01a12b23d68eb6cd991ee08569303/data/cora_labels.jld2", "cora_labels.jld2")

@load "./cora_features.jld2" features
@load "./cora_labels.jld2" labels
@load "./cora_graph.jld2" g
```

## Model and Data Configuration

The `num_nodes`, `target_catg` and `num_features` are defined by the data itself. We shall use a shallow GNN with only 16 hidden state dimension.

```julia
num_nodes = 2708
num_features = 1433
hidden = 16
target_catg = 7
epochs = 40
```

## Preprocessing the Data

Convert the data to float32 and use `LightGraphs` to get the adjacency matrix from the graph `g`.

```julia
train_X = Float32.(features)  # dim: num_features * num_nodes
train_y = Float32.(labels)  # dim: target_catg * num_nodes

adj_mat = Matrix{Float32}(adjacency_matrix(g))
```

## Neural Graph Ordinary Differential Equations

Let us now define the final model. We will use a single layer GNN for approximating the gradients for the neural ODE. We use two additional `GCNConv` layers, one to project the data to a latent space and the other to project it from the latent space to the predictions. Finally a softmax layer gives us the probability of the input belonging to each target category.

```julia
diffeqarray_to_array(x) = reshape(cpu(x), size(x)[1:2])

node = NeuralODE(
    GCNConv(adj_mat, hidden=>hidden),
    (0.f0, 1.f0), Tsit5(), save_everystep = false,
    reltol = 1e-3, abstol = 1e-3, save_start = false
)

model = Chain(GCNConv(adj_mat, num_features=>hidden, relu),
              Dropout(0.5),
              node,
              diffeqarray_to_array,
              GCNConv(adj_mat, hidden=>target_catg))
```

## Training Configuration

### Loss Function and Accuracy

We shall be using the standard categorical crossentropy loss function which is used for multiclass classification tasks.

```julia
loss(x, y) = logitcrossentropy(model(x), y)
accuracy(x, y) = mean(onecold(model(x)) .== onecold(y))
```

### Model Parameters

Now we extract the model parameters which we want to learn.

```julia
ps = Flux.params(model, node.p);
```

### Training Data

GNNs operate on an entire graph, so we can't do any sort of minibatching here. We need to pass the entire data in a single pass. So our dataset is an array with a single tuple.

```julia
train_data = [(train_X, train_y)]
```

### Optimizer

For this task we will be using the `ADAM` optimizer with a learning rate of `0.01`.

```julia
opt = ADAM(0.01)
```

### Callback Function

We also define a utility function for printing the accuracy of the model over time.

```julia
evalcb() = @show(accuracy(train_X, train_y))
```

## Training Loop

Finally, with the configuration ready and all the utilities defined we can use the `Flux.train!` function to learn the parameters `ps`. We run the training loop for `epochs` number of iterations.

```julia
for i = 1:epochs
    Flux.train!(loss, ps, train_data, opt, cb=throttle(evalcb, 10))
end
```
