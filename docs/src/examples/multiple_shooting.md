# Multiple Shooting

!!! note
    
    The form of multiple shooting found here is a specialized form for implicit layer deep learning (known as data shooting) which assumes full observability of the underlying dynamics and lack of noise. For a more general implementation of multiple shooting, see [JuliaSimModelOptimizer](https://help.juliahub.com/jsmo/stable/). For an implementation more directly tied to parameter estimation against data, see [DiffEqParamEstim.jl](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqParamEstim/stable/).

In Multiple Shooting, the training data is split into overlapping intervals.
The solver is then trained on individual intervals. If the end conditions of any
interval coincide with the initial conditions of the next immediate interval,
then the joined/combined solution is the same as solving on the whole dataset
(without splitting).

To ensure that the overlapping part of two consecutive intervals coincide,
we add a penalizing term:

`continuity_term * absolute_value_of(prediction of last point of group i - prediction of first point of group i+1)`

to the loss.

Note that the `continuity_term` should have a large positive value to add
high penalties in case the solver predicts discontinuous values.

The following is a working demo, using Multiple Shooting:

```@example multiple_shooting
using ComponentArrays, Lux, DiffEqFlux, Optimization, OptimizationPolyalgorithms,
      OrdinaryDiffEq, Plots
using DiffEqFlux: group_ranges

using Random
rng = Xoshiro(0)

# Define initial conditions and time steps
datasize = 30
u0 = Float32[2.0, 0.0]
tspan = (0.0f0, 5.0f0)
tsteps = range(tspan[1], tspan[2]; length = datasize)

# Get the data
function trueODEfunc(du, u, p, t)
    true_A = [-0.1 2.0; -2.0 -0.1]
    du .= ((u .^ 3)'true_A)'
end
prob_trueode = ODEProblem(trueODEfunc, u0, tspan)
ode_data = Array(solve(prob_trueode, Tsit5(); saveat = tsteps))

# Define the Neural Network
nn = Chain(x -> x .^ 3, Dense(2, 16, tanh), Dense(16, 2))
p_init, st = Lux.setup(rng, nn)

ps = ComponentArray(p_init)
pd, pax = getdata(ps), getaxes(ps)

neuralode = NeuralODE(nn, tspan, Tsit5(); saveat = tsteps)
prob_node = ODEProblem((u, p, t) -> nn(u, p, st)[1], u0, tspan, ComponentArray(p_init))

# Define parameters for Multiple Shooting
group_size = 3
continuity_term = 200

function loss_function(data, pred)
    return sum(abs2, data - pred)
end

l1,
preds = multiple_shoot(ps, ode_data, tsteps, prob_node, loss_function,
    Tsit5(), group_size; continuity_term)

function loss_multiple_shooting(p)
    ps = ComponentArray(p, pax)

    loss,
    currpred = multiple_shoot(ps, ode_data, tsteps, prob_node, loss_function,
        Tsit5(), group_size; continuity_term)
    global preds = currpred
    return loss
end

function plot_multiple_shoot(plt, preds, group_size)
    step = group_size - 1
    ranges = group_ranges(datasize, group_size)

    for (i, rg) in enumerate(ranges)
        plot!(plt, tsteps[rg], preds[i][1, :]; markershape = :circle, label = "Group $(i)")
    end
end

anim = Plots.Animation()
iter = 0
function callback(state, l; doplot = true, prob_node = prob_node)
    display(l)
    global iter
    iter += 1
    if doplot && iter % 1 == 0
        # plot the original data
        plt = scatter(tsteps, ode_data[1, :]; label = "Data")
        # plot the different predictions for individual shoot
        l1,
        preds = multiple_shoot(
            ComponentArray(state.u, pax), ode_data, tsteps, prob_node, loss_function,
            Tsit5(), group_size; continuity_term)
        plot_multiple_shoot(plt, preds, group_size)

        frame(anim)
        display(plot(plt))
    end
    return false
end

adtype = Optimization.AutoZygote()
optf = Optimization.OptimizationFunction((x, p) -> loss_multiple_shooting(x), adtype)
optprob = Optimization.OptimizationProblem(optf, pd)
res_ms = Optimization.solve(optprob, PolyOpt(); callback = callback, maxiters = 300)
gif(anim, "multiple_shooting.gif"; fps = 15)
```

The connected lines show the predictions of each group. Notice that there
are overlapping points as well. These are the points we are trying to coincide.

Here is an output with `group_size = 30` (which is the same as solving on the whole
interval without splitting also called single shooting).

```@example multiple_shooting
anim = Plots.Animation()
iter = 0
group_size = 30

ps = ComponentArray(p_init)
pd, pax = getdata(ps), getaxes(ps)

function loss_single_shooting(p)
    ps = ComponentArray(p, pax)
    loss,
    currpred = multiple_shoot(ps, ode_data, tsteps, prob_node, loss_function,
        Tsit5(), group_size; continuity_term)
    global preds = currpred
    return loss
end

adtype = Optimization.AutoZygote()
optf = Optimization.OptimizationFunction((x, p) -> loss_single_shooting(x), adtype)
optprob = Optimization.OptimizationProblem(optf, pd)
res_ms = Optimization.solve(optprob, PolyOpt(); callback = callback, maxiters = 300)
gif(anim, "single_shooting.gif"; fps = 15)
```

It is clear from the above picture, a single shoot doesn't perform very well
with the ODE Problem we have and gets stuck in a local minimum.
