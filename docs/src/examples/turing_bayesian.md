# Bayesian Estimation of Differential Equations with Probabilistic Programming

For a good overview of how to use the tools of SciML in conjunction with the
Turing.jl probabilistic programming language, see the
[Bayesian Differential Equation Tutorial](https://turing.ml/stable/tutorials/10-bayesian-differential-equations/).
